Budget planner: This feature can help users plan their monthly or yearly budget based on their income and expenses. You can use Python to create a graphical user interface (GUI) that allows users to input their income and expenses, and then display their budget summary and balance. You can use MySQL to store the user’s budget data in a table and perform queries to retrieve or update it. You can also use Python libraries such as matplotlib or seaborn to create charts and graphs that visualize the user’s budget data.

Investment calculator: This feature can help users calculate the future value of their investments based on different scenarios. You can use Python to create a GUI that allows users to input their initial investment amount, interest rate, compounding frequency, and time period. You can then use the formula for compound interest to calculate the future value of their investment. You can also use MySQL to store the user’s investment data in a table and perform queries to retrieve or update it. You can also use Python libraries such as numpy or scipy to perform numerical calculations and simulations.

Stock tracker: This feature can help users track their stocks and get real-time market data. You can use Python to create a GUI that allows users to input their stock symbols and quantities, and then display their stock portfolio value and performance. You can use MySQL to store the user’s stock data in a table and perform queries to retrieve or update it. You can also use Python libraries such as pandas or yfinance to get stock data from Yahoo Finance API and manipulate it. You can also use Python libraries such as plotly or bokeh to create interactive charts and graphs that visualize the user’s stock data.
